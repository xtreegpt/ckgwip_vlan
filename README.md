Verizon FIOS 3 router setup using vyos as the mid router. This script updates config if gateway IP changes on main router
you have to forward Verizon ports from main router to WAN side of Vyos. Vyos will pass the data to the FIOS router. This is so you can remotely control your DVR. See http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16858
